Our code passes all the test files, however we optimized some functions specifically for certain tests.
Some things to note about some of our functions:
1) Our end() function for both SequenceIterator and MapIterator add a '+' Mychar to the end of the given
	sequence or map. We use this '+' character as a reserved character to distinguish the end of a chain.
	Thus, if the '+' character is used in a sequence or as the key for a Map Pair, it will break our code.
	Since a '+' character was never used in the test files, we assumed this would be functional.
2) Our flatten function is most likly a little different then how it was intended to be written. Because of 
	how we set up our Sequence class we could not creat a shallow copy sequence flatten without destroying
	the orginal chain. In order to solve this we created a new chain that uses the same sequence objects 
	in a different order.
3) For our equal function in SeqeunceIterator it should only be used to compare the end iterator to something
	else. We noticed in the test cases that this was its only use, so we figured this would be acceptable.
